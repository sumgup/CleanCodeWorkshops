The Dependency-Inversion Principle
==================================

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend
on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon
abstractions.

---------------------

Consider the implications of high-level modules that depend on low-level modules. It is the high-level
modules that contain the important policy decisions and business models of an application. These
modules contain the identity of the application. Yet when these modules depend on the lower-level
modules, changes to the lower-level modules can have direct effects on the higher-level modules and
can force them to change in turn.
