## **Concepts**

### State
A computer program stores data in variables, which represent storage locations in the computer's memory. **The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution, is called the program's state.**

### Programming Paradigm

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.  Languages can be classified in multiple paradigms. 

Common programming paradigms include:

- [imperative](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Imperative_programming) which allows side effects,
- [functional](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Functional_programming) which disallows side effects,
- [declarative](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Declarative_programming) which does not state the order in which operations execute,
- [object-oriented](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Object-oriented_programming) which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
- [procedural](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Procedural_programming) which groups code into functions,
- [logic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Logic_programming) which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
- symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar.

For example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code.
