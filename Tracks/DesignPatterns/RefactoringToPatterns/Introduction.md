#### Refactoring

**Code refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the *factoring*—without changing its external behavior.

Improves:

1. Source Code Maintainability
2. Reduces Complexity
3. Creates an Architecture to improve Extensibility

#### Factoring

Decomposition in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain.

#### Code Smells

The Code Smells are key signs that refactoring is necessary. For e.g. Method is very long.  Before refactoring a section of code, a solid set of automatic unit tests is needed.
